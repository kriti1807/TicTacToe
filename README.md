**ABOUT THE APP**

This app is designed to free the user from the hassle of pen and paper while playing this game. It is basically a two-player classic game, in which one player gets an X and the other player get O to play. It has 9 boxes which are represented as a 3x3 grid. In order to win, the player has to make a sequence of three consecutive X&#39;s or three consecutive O&#39;s either horizontally or vertically or diagonally. Also, only one player can win as it is a two-player game only. But, if no one was able to make their sequence, then the game would end up with a tie.

**HOW TO PLAY:**

In order to play this exciting game, all you would require is your mobile phone and two players. As the game starts, both the players will get either X or a O. Then, the player with an X plays the first turn followed by the player with O. Each player will get minimum 3 chances which could extend to 4 or 5. But, if none of the players where able to end up with a sequence, then the game has to be a tie between both the players.

**7.TROUBLRSHOOTING TIPS**

If you are facing any issues with the installation and compilation of the application, first I would suggest you to look out for  minor errors are closing of a bracket or something like that. If, there are no minors errors then, you must check the SDK files and the version of your android studio as some older versions do not support specific functions used in the programming. I have used Android Studio 4.1.3 version, so you have you make sure you have using this version and not older. Also, for the SDK files, you would first have to go to tools -> SDK Manager-> then a window will pop up. In that pop-up window click on Android SDK and there you must have either of the below packages installed:

Android S Preview

Android 11.0(R)

Android 10.0(Q)
